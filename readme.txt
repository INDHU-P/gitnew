Hey guys,
    The command you have to learn to use git are:
            1)git init #initialising an empty git file
            2) git add "filename"#or '.'(dot) for all the files in the folder.This should be done by going into the directory 
            3)git commit -m 
            4)git push origin master
            5)git clone "URL" eg.git clone https://github.com/outoftune2000/gitnew.git
            6)git reset --soft HEAD^ #removes the last commit without causing any changes to the file in your system
            7)git reset --hard HEAD^ #removes the last commit and also cancels any changes you have made in the file
            8)git pull origin master #Used to fetch the newly added files to your system
